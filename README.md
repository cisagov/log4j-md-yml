This repository contains Python code to:

1. (Work in Progress) Translate the Markdown table of vulnerable software
   from [NCSC-NL/log4shell](https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell) into a
   common YAML format: [`convert-nscs-nl`](src/mdyml/convert_ncsc_nl.py)
1. Merge the YAML from the previous step with the YAML from
   [cisagov/log4j-affected-db](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db)
   into one grand YAML file: [`normalize-yml`](src/yml/normalize_yml.py)
1. Generate a Markdown table from the YAML output of the previous step:
   [`yml2md`](src/ymlmd/yml2md.py)
1. Generate Markdown based on a Markdown template file and a file containing
   a Markdown table such as the output of the previous step:
   [`md-from-template`](src/md_from_template/md_from_template.py)

## Common YAML format ##

The common YAML format looks like this:

```yaml

          - 1.1
        cve: cve-2021-44228
        fixed_versions:
          - 1.2
        investigated: true
        unaffected_versions: []
    notes: Blah blah blah
    product: ProductA
    references:
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/Vendor1/comments/abcdef/log4j

The subfields in the `cves` entries are as follows:

| `cves` subfield  | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `cve` | The [CVE ID](https://www.cve.org/) of the particular log4j vulnerability.  The only valid value is [`cve-2021-44228`](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228). |
| `affected_versions` | A list of the versions of the product that are vulnerable to the particular CVE. |
| `fixed_versions` | A list of the versions of the product that are patched and therefore unaffected by the particular CVE. |
